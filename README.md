# Laphet
Laphet: A lightweight toolkit for exploring neural network language models with Python. Ideal for educational purposes, it supports next-word prediction and evaluation using simplified implementations of MLP, Bi-LSTM, Transformer, BERT and GPT. The project takes its name from [Laphet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahpet) (Burmese: လက်ဖက်), the iconic fermented tea leaves of Myanmar, a personal favorite of the author.
